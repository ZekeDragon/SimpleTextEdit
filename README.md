# Simple Qt Text Editor Application
Second in a series of Weekend Projects by Ezekiel Oruven/KirHut Software.

The text editor application takes advantage of the many free text editing capabilities built-in to the Qt framework.
This fortunately includes functionality like undo/redo and copy/paste from outside of the application, so a lot of the
complexity of working with an operating system is gone, and this should all work in the majority of operating systems.
Since a text editor is a very simple project and realistically I had a good working model within a couple hours, this
project should become perhaps a very lightweight and decent Markdown editor, using Qt's Rich Text editing functions.

I don't see why that can't be done in a weekend.
